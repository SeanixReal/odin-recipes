    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour.</li>
        <li>Divide butter evenly into the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin, about 1/2 teaspoon per cup.</li>
        <li>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven until butter has melted and is sizzling hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven, and distribute batter evenly among each cup.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until puffed and golden, without peeking, about 25 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
